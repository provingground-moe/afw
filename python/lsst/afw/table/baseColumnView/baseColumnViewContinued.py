        Any number of glob patterns may be passed (including none); the result
        will be the union of all the result of each glob considered
        separately.

        Note that extract("*", copy=True) provides an easy way to transform a
        row-major ColumnView into a possibly more efficient set of contiguous
        NumPy arrays.

        This routines unpacks `Flag` columns into full boolean arrays and
        covariances into dense (i.e. non-triangular packed) arrays with
        dimension (N,M,M), where N is the number of records and M is the
        dimension of the covariance matrix.  String fields are silently
        ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        patterns : Array of `str`
            List of glob patterns to use to select field names.
        kwds : `dict`
            Dictionary of additional keyword arguments.  May contain:
            - ``items`` : `list`
                The result of a call to self.schema.extract(); this
                will be used instead of doing any new matching, and
                allows the pattern matching to be reused to extract
                values from multiple records.  This keyword is
                incompatible with any position arguments and the
                regex, sub, and ordered keyword arguments.
            - ``where`` : array index expression
                Any expression that can be passed as indices to a
                NumPy array, including slices, boolean arrays, and
                index arrays, that will be used to index each column
                array.  This is applied before arrays are copied when
                copy is True, so if the indexing results in an
                implicit copy no unnecessary second copy is performed.
            - ``copy`` : `bool`
                If True, the returned arrays will be contiguous copies
                rather than strided views into the catalog.  This
                ensures that the lifetime of the catalog is not tied
                to the lifetime of a particular catalog, and it also
                may improve the performance if the array is used
                repeatedly. Default is False.
            - ``regex`` : `str` or `re` pattern
                A regular expression to be used in addition to any
                glob patterns passed as positional arguments.  Note
                that this will be compared with re.match, not
                re.search.
            - ``sub`` : `str`
                A replacement string (see re.MatchObject.expand) used
                to set the dictionary keys of any fields matched by
                regex.
            - ``ordered`` : `bool`
                If True, a collections.OrderedDict will be returned
                instead of a standard dict, with the order
                corresponding to the definition order of the
                Schema. Default is False.

        Returns
        -------
        d : `dict`
            Dictionary of extracted name-column array sets.

        Raises
        ------
